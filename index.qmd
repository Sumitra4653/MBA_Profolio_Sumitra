## About Me

  <!-- LEFT SIDE: TEXT -->
  <div style="flex: 2;">
    I am an MBA candidate at University Canada West with interests in
    operations, digital transformation, and data-driven decision making.
    I have hands-on experience in media and marketing with more than
    two years of experience as a marketing officer. The job included
    simple market research, designing promotional content, and
    maintaining social media platforms. I also worked as a sales
    associate where I gained teamwork, communication skills, and the
    ability to work under pressure.  
    <br><br>
    This portfolio highlights selected coursework, projects, and skills 
    that demonstrate my analytical thinking, collaboration, and 
    communication.
